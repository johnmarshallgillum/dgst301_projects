Bakkkery Bot

My bot was created a few days ago.  The name is "Bakkkery" and the profile picture and cover photo is of some nice desserts.  I will hopefully get the bot to tweet out a picture of a bakery to anyone that tweets "bakery" on twitter.  I'm not sure of the purpose of this but it's all for good fun.
